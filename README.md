# Dreambox Github Plugin Installer
Convenience installer of github-hosted plugins

## About

This shell script allows the installation of dreambox plugins hosted at github for
non-experienced users.

## Usage

The normal case is, that this installer is downloaded and directly executed as
`root` from the command line of a dreambox.

Example:

    curl -sL https://github.com/divinity666/dm-plugin-installer/raw/master/dm-plugin-installer.sh | sh

The command line user interface will then guide you through the installation. Please note that this
sample call won't install anything.
